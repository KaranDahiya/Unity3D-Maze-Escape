# Unity3D-Maze-Escape
**Description**

This is the code I wrote for the first game I made while messing around with Unity3D. It's a mix of horror and arcade. The player must escape from a maze in limited lighting/visibility while avoiding confrontation with frightening enemies.

**Technologies**

- C#
